STUDENTSÂ´ COMMENTS GEN.PROJECT

#I work as an ESL teacher in Brazil. As a teacher, I have to write comments on students' performances based on their scores (minors get the comments in Portuguese so parents can understand and students over 18 get the comments in English). So to save time, I wrote this Python code (my very first one) which asks for three different inputs (name of the student/score/minor or not) and can return three different comments.

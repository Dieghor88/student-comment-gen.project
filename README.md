#I work as an ESL teacher in Brazil. As a teacher I have to write comments on students performances based on their scores and wheter they are minors or not (minor get the comment in Portuguese so parents can understand and students who are over 18 years old get the comments in English). So to save time, I wrote this Python code (my very first one) which asks for three different inputs (name of the student/score/minor or not) and returns a comment.

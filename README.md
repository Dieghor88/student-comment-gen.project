STUDENTS´ COMMENT GENERATOR

DESCRIPTION:
I work as an ESL teacher in Brazil. As a teacher, I have to write comments on students' performances based on their scores (minors get the comments in Portuguese so parents can understand and students over 18 get the comments in English). So to save time, I wrote this Python code (my very first one) which asks for three different inputs (name of the student/score/minor or not) and can return three different comments.

USAGE:
I believe this small code, with a nice GUI, can be useful to all the teachers who work at my school and have to go through this every time we have to write a report. 

SUPPORT/CONTRIBUTING:
I would appreciate any ideas or suggestions on how to improve my code. Since this is my very first Python project, I am sure there is room for improvement. 

AUTHOR AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
This was my first Python project so I am the only author of it.

LICENSE:
If you are a teacher too, feel free to use it if like me you waste a lot of good time writing comments to all of your students. 

PROJECT STATUS:
I can´t say this project is down because I still need to learn how to create a nice and simple GUI for it. I want the teachers from my school to be able to install this on their computers and use it.
